Operations: Smart Daily Report Aggregator for Team Leads 
Problem Statement: Team leads face difficulty consolidating daily reports from multiple team members across channels (email, forms). 

Goal: To automate the collection of end-of-day updates via Google Form or email, classify updates into categories like “Completed,” “Blocked,” and “Planned,” and generate a neatly formatted summary email for management — improving operational clarity and performance tracking.
